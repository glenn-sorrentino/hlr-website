                    <p>"Thanks to whistleblowing leaks, gold mines of valuable digital data now exist. There is no better account than Micah Lee’s lively and readable how-to guide for arming journalists and researchers with the tools necessary to find, excavate, and make sense of this rich data. Sourced from Lee’s experiences mining data for his hard-hitting journalistic exposes, readers will come away inspired and equipped to follow in his footsteps."</p>

Not only will it teach you the technical skills to download and analyze large datasets, you’ll also learn how to automate investigative tasks to let your computer do some of the heavy lifting. You’ll also get an inside look at some of Micah’s own work scouring through chat logs and analyzing file dumps for some groundbreaking investigations."</p>

                    <p>"As a journalist who has been working with data breaches for close to ten years, actually getting to grips with that data is often the hardest part of any reporting project. Lee's clear and concise book will be an invaluable resource for reporters or researchers just dipping into this sort of data, or those looking for new techniques. I will certainly be using some of the tools myself. Hacked and dumped datasets are rich sources of information that is the public interest, and Lee's book will only increase the number of important stories others are able to extract from them."</p>
